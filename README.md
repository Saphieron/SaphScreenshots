# SaphScreenshots

A little side project to create a screenshotting tool for (at least) Linux that should have the following feature:
    - Take a screenshot of all screens together
    - Take a screenshot of a single screen
    - Take a screenshot of manually selected small area
    - **Draw on the resulting screenshot**, e.g. by encircling something in it.

This is obviously meant as a tool similar to what the windows screenshooting tool offers, which still seems to not exist as such (any more) for Linux.
